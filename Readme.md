## Project Description

The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard is designed to visualize and analyze transaction data from multiple coffee shop locations. It aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights to improve sales strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance overall business performance.

## Data Source

The primary data source for this project is the `Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx` Excel file, which contains two sheets:

1. **Dashboards Sheet**: Contains summarized data for creating high-level visuals, including:
   - Total revenue by month
   - Aggregated metrics for quick insights

2. **Transactions Sheet**: Detailed transactional data for each sale, including:
   - `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
   - `transaction_date`: Date and time of the transaction
   - `store_location`: Location of the coffee shop
   - `product_category`: Category of the product sold (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Drinking Chocolate)
   - `revenue`: Revenue generated from the transaction

## Dashboard Features

1. **Monthly Revenue Analysis**
   - Visualizes total revenue for each month
   - Identifies trends and seasonal variations in coffee shop sales

2. **Product Category Performance**
   - Breaks down sales by product category
   - Highlights top-performing products and areas for improvement

3. **Store Performance Comparison**
   - Compares sales performance across different coffee shop locations
   - Provides insights into geographic sales patterns and local market preferences

4. **Time-Based Sales Trends**
   - Analyzes sales based on the day of the week and hour of the day
   - Identifies peak sales periods to optimize staffing and inventory management

5. **Interactive Filters**
   - Allows users to drill down into specific date ranges, locations, or product categories
   - Enables customized views for targeted analysis
